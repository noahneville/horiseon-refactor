# Horiseon-Refactor

This is my first project for my Web Development Bootcamp. In it, we were tasked with refactoring the HTML and CSS documents for a website for a fake SEO company. 

In the HTML file, I changed all 'div' tags to semantic elements to improve readability and accessibility. I also consolidated redundant classes and deleted unnecessary ones. I fixed broken links and added alt descriptors to images for accessibility. 

In my CSS file, I combined the CSS rules of consolidated classes to improve efficiency and commented out the rules I didn't need. 

Here's a preview of what the site should look like:
